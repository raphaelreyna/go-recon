# This is a config file for the example program for the Go package recon (https://github.com/raphaelreyna/go-recon)
#
# If the example program is run and finds this file (recon.yaml) in its current directory,
# then it tries to add all of the files listed in the files section below to its current directory.
#
# The files listed in the files section will be searched for by name (or location if given):
# 1 - in the directories listed in the source_dirs section below,
# 2 - as a url,
# 3 - as a shell script.
files:
  # List the files you want to be added to this directory in this section.
  # Files will be searched for by name and be placed into this directory with the name name.
  # If a location (optional) is provided, the file will instead be searched for by location rather than by name.
